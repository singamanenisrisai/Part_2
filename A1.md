###  First Application: SHAZAM
#### Link to application:
1.  <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android>
2.  <https://itunes.apple.com/app/shazam/id284993459?mt=8>
*	In “Shazam” app we find new songs, purchase and even able to share songs with our friends. We can go through lyrics of songs and along with all the mentioned above features every popular artist has their shazam page in which we can find their biography, tunes, lyrics for their compositions and news regarding their upcoming tunes.
* The reason for choosing this app is it gives us complete details of every song playing around us by just tapping the shazam logo. Its very simple to know the details of songs playing around us. It uses our microphone to tag the songs playing around you.
*	And the coolest feature included now is the AR mode which uses our camera, by scanning the shazam logo given to us by purchasing albums we unlock the AR mode for that album where in that the artist comes in front of us on the screen and dances according to the tune and many other crazy movements are included.
*	This application is even compatible with our smart watches. In addition to this there is a feature called “Auto Shazam”, by long pressing the shazam logo we can automatically track the song playing around us using our microphone even in our smart watches and get its details.
*	The biggest strength of this application is it is one of its kind and very famous for recognizing the song by just listening to the tune for just 10 seconds.
*	This application also has a premium version which is just add free. It means that the only difference between free version and premium is add free. If I were allowed to make changes I prefer to add few more features to the paid version of the application like access to some songs, if we purchase a paid application and get some exciting AR videos exclusively for the paid users.

#### First Heuristic Evaluation: User Control and Freedom
*	The application is very simple to use. Every process in this application has clear indications about internal directions in the application.
*	There are multiple paths on home page such as by pressing the shazam logo it starts listening the song playing around us, to leave that or to cancel that there is a clear logo of “X” on the left corner to leave the page and go back to home page along side our phone default navigation buttons can also be used to navigate inside the application.
*	In the similar way for AR mode there is clear marked exit button on the left corner of the screen which is pretty simple to identify.

#### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Flexibility and Efficiency of use
*	There is one feature available for this application called “Auto Shazam”.  This is a handy feature for experienced users.
*	To activate this feature in the application long press the logo. By activating this feature application logo will act as a shortcut to tune the song playing around us.
*	From then whenever we need to record a tune playing around us, we can just long press the application logo to record and auto save the song details in the app.
*	This save a lot of time for the user who is frequently using this application. And we can even enable this mode in our smart watches too.

###  Second Application: JUST DIAL (JD)

*	Just Dial app is “All in One Application” which provides user many things to do with just using one application. This application provides exact definition for Native Apps.
*	We can book flights, hotels, movies, concerts, restaurants, taxis, get a consultation with doctor, purchase groceries, find beauty and spas near you, get advising with finance and investments, get information about home improvement and home services and repairs, provides insurance details, find details about wedding planners, books, catering services, car rentals, also finds best deals near you and many more…
*	The major advantage of this application is it replaces many app’s in our phone. By installing this app, we can manage everything. It saves a lot of memory in our phone and having everything under one nest is good because, instead of dispersing things like credit card information, insurance information, car details, and every other thing in different applications we can now save them in Just Dial app. And also, we can access multiple things at a time and get notifications for everything by using only one app.
*	There is lite version of this app which offers more than half of the features offered by the main application. This lite version is very fast in searching things. This application is more kind of a search engine in which we can get almost each and every information that regular user requires in his day to day life.
*	We also get a Jet Pay feature in which we enclose our credit/debit card information and when we need to pay money we can just simply pay it using “Jet Pay”.
*	This app also displays user ratings for different categories such as provides ratings for Restaurants, Electronics gadgets, movies, hospitals, shopping centers, hotels, and many more...
*	It uses our GPS location to track our current position and gives result according to the location and places nearby us. It displays things like hotels, malls, hospitals, etc. according to their distance from us in increasing order.

#### First Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition rather than recall
*	In this application the instructions are clearly mentioned where ever we are navigated. User is always informed about his location inside the app, when he navigates into the pages of the application.
*	The information provided is either written on the top bar or may be a logo representing the appropriate information and different options are also specified for the user to navigate from one category to other.

#### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design

*	The best thing about this is app is it is advertisement free.
*	Information regarding the content is only displayed, rather than any unnecessary or irrelevant information it only has information about the products which is explained to the user in the best possible way.
*	This makes this application very user friendly and hassle free to use all the time when needed.
